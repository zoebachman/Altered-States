## Workshop Description
**Whose stories dominate urban memory? Who is “allowed” to participate in the process of placemaking? How do we construct alternative modes of engaging with a public space?**

Locative media, or location-aware interactive environments or technologies, include everything from mobile games to responsive installations to maps that use geospatial data. Artists and activists use locative technologies to present alternative narratives in a process of communal fact creation.

In this Fact Craft workshop, we will work specifically with augmented reality (AR) to layer multimedia on top of existing spaces. We will teach tactics for imagining alternative narratives as well as methods for critically observing and engaging with urban spaces. Over the course of two sessions, participants will learn how artists use a variety of mediums to augment and reclaim public space and how to create an AR piece that responds to and intervenes in a place of personal significance.
